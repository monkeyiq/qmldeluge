The desktop entry expects the installation to live in /home/user/qmldeluge 
and for you to run the app inside qmlviewer. Running as root on the device
# desktop-file-install qmldeluge.desktop
will setup an icon on the phone and you should be good to go.

The UI updates every few seconds, allows pause and start of torrents and 
removing the torrent (but not the data) when you click the minus sign.

Enjoy.
