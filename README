SETUP:
At the top of qmldeluge.qml you will see cfgURL and cfgPasswrd which you have to set 
to the server and password you want to use. Using the SQLite offline storage API to set and get the server address, user password and some other settings might be handy...

The desktop entry expects the installation to live in /home/user/qmldeluge 
and for you to run the app inside qmlviewer. Running as root on the device
# desktop-file-install qmldeluge.desktop
will setup an icon on the phone and you should be good to go.

The UI updates every few seconds, allows pause and start of torrents and 
removing the torrent (but not the data) when you click the minus sign.

Enjoy.
